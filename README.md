# 💰 Predicting Paychecks with Machine Learning in Python

## 📖 Overview
This project predicts whether an individual earns **more than $50K per year** based on demographic and employment attributes.  
It uses the **Adult Income Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)** and demonstrates **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling** in Python.  

The goal is to show how machine learning can be applied to **real-world income classification problems**.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- A **sample dataset** is included in this repo:  
  [`data/sample_adult.csv`](data/sample_adult.csv) (50 rows for quick testing).  
- The **full dataset** can be downloaded from the [UCI Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).  

### Features
- Age, Education, Marital Status, Occupation, Relationship, Race, Sex, Hours worked per week, Country, etc.  
- Target variable: **Income (<=50K or >50K)**

# Predicting Paychecks with Machine Learning in Python

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook: **`Predicting_Paychecks.ipynb`**
2. Run all cells in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

The notebook will:

- Load dataset (`sample_adult.csv`)
- Perform data cleaning & preprocessing
- Do exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- Evaluate accuracy

---

## 📈 Results

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** ~83%  
- **Decision Tree Accuracy:** ~81%  

> ⚠️ Results may vary slightly depending on train-test split.  
> Sample output plots and confusion matrix are included in the notebook.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
- Handle class imbalance with SMOTE/oversampling  
- Deploy model as a Flask/Streamlit web app on Heroku/AWS

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 🐍**
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** → ML models
